# Java Collections

Any group of individual objects that are represented as a single unit is known as a Java Collection of Objects.
In Java, the Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.

- Class: A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

- Interface: Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract (only method signature, nobody). Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
